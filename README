*DON'T USE ON A LIVE SERVER OR WITH ANYTH YOU CARE ABOUT OR ON A MACHINE THAT HAS ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT OR A MACHINE THAT EVEN HAS ACCESS TO ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT*

This script plays with files and has no real protections beyond a basic password to keep your files secure.

Things you should be aware of:
XSS attacks will work if you are logged in.
Delete a folder by clicking a link... any folder the CF user has access to potentially system folders.
Demo user has a password that should be changed or the user erased altogether(recommended)

Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, what is this project?

Just a playground for making an editor that runs in a browser, ideally on a server(not there yet for reasons mentioned above).

For now, it lets you browse, edit, create, and delete files/folders at a very basic level. Enhancements to come.

==== Install ====

Download/unzip folder into a cfenabled directory.
Change demo user password(change username too while you're in there)
	config/users.cfm
		authedUsers.demo.passwordHash = hash("your new password here", "SHA-512")

		I'd recommend actually hashing the password and storing the hash instead of the function... kinda defeats the purpose of it all if you don't.

==== Use ====

Login by visiting installPath/comiEditor/ in your browser.

Give me feedback/suggestions!
